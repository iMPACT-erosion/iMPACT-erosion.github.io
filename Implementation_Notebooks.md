The **iRONS Implementation Notebooks** is a set of workflow examples showing how to apply the iRONS functions to real-world data and problems including: generating inflow forecasts through a rainfall-runoff model, including bias correcting weather forecasts; optimising release scheduling against an inflow scenario or a forecast ensemble; optimising an operating policy against time series of historical or synthetic inflows. These Notebooks are meant to serve as a ‘learn-by-doing’ alternative to a User manual and a starting point for the user’s own application workflows.

This is the list all the Notebooks that are currently included in iRONS including their description and links to run them online:

**1.a. Downloading ensemble weather forecasts:** downloads ensemble weather forecasts/hindcasts from the ECMWF public dataset.

**1.b. Bias correction of weather forecasts:** applies a linear scaling approach to correct the bias of seasonal forecasts (rainfall, temperature and evaporation ensembles).

**2.a. Generation of reservoir inflow ensemble forecasts from weather forecasts:** uses the HBV model to simulate the inflow forecast into a water reservoir using the seasonal forecasts, both in a deterministic and in a stochastic manner, as forcing inputs. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/B%20-%20Implementation/2.a.%20Generation%20of%20reservoir%20inflow%20ensemble%20forecasts%20from%20weather%20forecasts.ipynb)

**3.a. Multi-objective optimisation of reservoir release scheduling:** simulates and applies multi-objective optimization to find optimal release and pumped inflows scheduling in some illustrative study-cases. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/B%20-%20Implementation/3.a.%20Multi-objective%20optimisation%20of%20reservoir%20release%20scheduling.ipynb)

**3.b. Multi-objective optimisation of reservoir operating policy:** uses an operating policy function, together with a simulation model and optimisation algorithm, to assist the long-term operation of a water reservoir system. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/B%20-%20Implementation/3.b.%20Multi-objective%20optimisation%20of%20reservoir%20operating%20policy.ipynb)
