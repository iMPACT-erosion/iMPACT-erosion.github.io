## iMPACT-erosion (interactive Modular Playful Accesible Transparent erosion modelling)

iMPACT-erosion is a Python package that makes soil erosion modelling more playful, accessible and transparent. iMPACT-erosion provides a set of Python functions (iMPACT Functions) simulating typical soil erosion processes and a set of interactive Jupyter Notebooks (iMPACT Notebooks) that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples.

### iMPACT Software

The iRONS Software is a set of Python functions implementing typical reservoir modelling tasks, such as: estimating inflows to a reservoir, simulating operator decisions, closing the reservoir mass balance equation – in the context of both short-term forecasting and long-term predictions.

You can download the functions from the iRONS Github repository: [iRONS Software](https://github.com/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/tree/master/iRONS/Software/)

### iMPACT Notebooks

The package includes a set of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples, and that can be run in the Jupyter environment either locally or remotely via a web browser.
The notebooks included in iMPACT-erosion are divided in two sections:

**A.	[Knowledge Transfer (KT) Notebooks](./KT_Notebooks.md/):** A set of simple examples to demonstrate the value of simulation tools for soil erosion management – i.e. why one should use these tools in the first place. 

**B.	[Implementation Notebooks](./Implementation_Notebooks.md/):** A set of workflow examples showing how to apply the iMPACT-erosion tools to more complex problems such as: 

You can download the Notebooks from the iMPACT-erosion Github repository: [iMPACT Notebooks](https://github.com/iMPACT-erosion/iMPACT-erosion/tree/master/Notebooks/)

The iMPACT Notebooks can be run on the cloud by using Binder (https://mybinder.org/), so that they are accessible by a web browser without requiring the installation of Python. Just click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FiRONS/Notebooks)
