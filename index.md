## **iMPACT-erosion (interactive Modular Playful Accesible Transparent erosion modelling)**

iMPACT-erosion is a project that aims to **democratise** soil erosion modelling by fostering a more **educational, playful and exploratory** experience. To achieve this goal, the project adopts a **learn-by-doing** approach, allowing users of varying modeling expertise – **from novices to experts** – to get familiar with soil erosion modeling concepts and procedures simply by interacting with modelling tools.

iMPACT-erosion offers a comprehensive set of **interactive Jupyter Notebooks** and **Python functions** that guide users through the entire hydrological + soil erosion modelling process. These resources are organized into three stages: **Start, Test and Explore**

### **1. iMPACT Start**

The iMPACT Start is a set of Notebooks explaining and implementing the starting soil erosion modelling tasks: 
- Catchment delineation:  this includes the filling of the DEM sinks, computation flow accumulation areas and flow routing.
- Estimation of the effective rainfall and soil moisture
- Soil detachment by r
- 

You can find these Notebooks at the iRONS Github repository: [iMPACT Learn](https://github.com/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/tree/master/iRONS/Software/)

### **2. iMPACT Test**

The package includes a set of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples, and that can be run in the Jupyter environment either locally or remotely via a web browser.
The notebooks included in iMPACT-erosion are divided in two sections:

**A.	[Knowledge Transfer (KT) Notebooks](./KT_Notebooks.md/):** A set of simple examples to demonstrate the value of simulation tools for soil erosion management – i.e. why one should use these tools in the first place. 

**B.	[Implementation Notebooks](./Implementation_Notebooks.md/):** A set of workflow examples showing how to apply the iMPACT-erosion tools to more complex problems such as: 

You can download the Notebooks from the iMPACT-erosion Github repository: [iMPACT Notebooks](https://github.com/iMPACT-erosion/iMPACT-erosion/tree/master/Notebooks/)

The iMPACT Notebooks can be run on the cloud by using Binder (https://mybinder.org/), so that they are accessible by a web browser without requiring the installation of Python. Just click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FiRONS/Notebooks)

### **3. iMPACT Explore**

### Install iMPACT-erosion locally ###

To install iMPACT-erosion on your computer: [Install iMPACT-erosion](./Install.md/)
