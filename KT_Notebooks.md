The **iRONS Knowledge Transfer (KT) Notebooks** is a set of simple examples to demonstrate the value of simulation and optimisation tools for reservoir operations by application to ‘proof-of-concept’ systems. 

This is the list all the Notebooks that are currently included in iRONS including their description and links to run them online:

**1.a. Simple example of how to use Jupyter Notebooks:** uses a sound wave example to show how to use Jupyter Notebooks and interactive visualization elements. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/1.a.%20Simple%20example%20of%20how%20to%20use%20Jupyter%20Notebooks.ipynb)

**2.a. Calibration and evaluation of a rainfall-runoff model:** shows how to calibrate, both manually and automatically, a rainfall-runoff model, which could be used to estimate reservoir inflows. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/2.a.%20Calibration%20and%20evaluation%20of%20a%20rainfall-runoff%20model.ipynb)

**3.a. Recursive decisions and multi-objective optimisation:** shows how simulation models and optimisation algorithms can be used to derive optimal release scheduling for a simple water reservoir system. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/3.a.%20Recursive%20decisions%20and%20multi-objective%20optimisation.ipynb)

**3.b. Decision making under uncertainty:** shows how to deal with uncertainty - and the difference between deterministic and stochastic optimisation - when deriving optimal reservoir releases. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/3.b.%20Decision%20making%20under%20uncertainty.ipynb)

**3.c. Reservoir operating policy:** shows how to optimise the operating policy of a water reservoir system (using a “policy search” approach). [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/3.c.%20Reservoir%20operating%20policy.ipynb)

**3.d. Types of reservoir operating policies:** shows how to define different operating policies for different reservoir purposes and how to account for variability over the year. [**Link**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iRONStoolbox/iRONStoolbox/HEAD?urlpath=notebooks/iRONS/Notebooks/A%20-%20Knowledge%20transfer/3.d.%20Types%20of%20reservoir%20operating%20policies.ipynb)
